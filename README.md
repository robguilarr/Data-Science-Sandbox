# ðŸ§ª Machine Learning Sandbox

This repository is a sandbox for my Machine Learning studies. Here, I'll be 
experimenting with various Machine Learning models and techniques, and documenting my 
progress along the way.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following installed on 
your machine:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Among others...

You can install these packages using the following commands:

> `pip install -r source/requirements.txt`


Then, navigate to your directory and launch Jupyter Notebook by running the 
following command:

> `jupyter notebook`

You should now be able to open and run the Jupyter Notebook files in this repository.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files and directories:

`source/experiments`: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files with various 
Machine Learning experiments and tutorials.

`source/systems`: This section contains info about ML Systems (tentative), meantime 
documenting it in my [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) personal account.

`source/requirements`: Contains dependencies required.

`source/test_requirements`: Contains dependencies for testing and refactoring code.

`data`: This directory contains datasets used in the notebooks.

`conf/experiments`: Section to allocate hyper-parameters (tentative).

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this repository! If you have any suggestions or ideas for 
Machine Learning experiments or tutorials, feel free to create a pull request.
