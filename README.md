# Machine Learning Sandbox

This repository is a sandbox for my Machine Learning studies. Here, I will be 
experimenting with various Machine Learning models and techniques, and documenting my 
progress along the way.

Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following installed on 
your machine:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
