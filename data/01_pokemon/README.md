# Context

Pokémon GO is a mobile videogame which was released in summer 2019. This dataset would 
be interesting if one wants to extract dependances of the maximum CP a Pokémon can reach 
using linear model regression, for example. Although there exists a theoretical formula 
in order to calculate this magnitude as function of base attack, defense and stamina, 
other variables as first and second type, capture and scape rate, etc, are included.
